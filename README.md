A 3D printable lock that is compatible with mass-produced KW1 locks. It is accurate enough to interchange parts.

An SLA printer will be required to hit acceptable tolerances. You will need springs, top pins and bottom pins for your chambers. Finally, you will need a retaining clip to hold the plug in the bible and will most likly need to use a Q-Tip to clean excess resin from the top of the chamber via the access ports in the bottom of the bible. This model is for educational and prototyping purposes, it was not designed for field use. Use at your own risk!
